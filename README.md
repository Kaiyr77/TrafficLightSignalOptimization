# 🚦 Deep Q-Learning for Intelligent Traffic Light Control

This project applies **Deep Reinforcement Learning (DQN)** to optimize traffic light control using the **SUMO traffic simulator** and a **custom Gym environment**.  
It demonstrates how intelligent agents can learn to minimize traffic congestion and vehicle waiting times through experience-based decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To develop an AI-based traffic light control system that adapts to real-time traffic flow and reduces congestion compared to traditional or random switching methods.

## 🧠 Methodology

### 🟠 Random Agent (Baseline)
A non-learning agent that switches lights randomly — used as a benchmark for comparison.  
- **Result:** 120 cars queued at peak.

### 🟢 Deep Q-Learning Agent
A reinforcement learning model that uses **neural networks** to estimate Q-values and learn optimal switching policies.  
- **Result:** Queue reduced to **30 cars**, showing a **75% improvement** in efficiency.  
- Learns from environment feedback using experience replay, target network updates, and ε-greedy exploration.
